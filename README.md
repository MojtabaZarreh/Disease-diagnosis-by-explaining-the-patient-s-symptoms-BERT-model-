# Disease-diagnosis-by-explaining-the-patient-s-symptoms-BERT-model
Hi,
In this project, I tried to investigate the performance of artificial intelligence in disease diagnosis by explaining the patient's symptoms.
It can predict more than 20 common diseases like a general practitioner from the patient's symptoms and dialogues
But it still needs a lot of improvement and I am trying to work on prescribing medicine over time.

I considered a simple UI for it with the help of Flask

I am trying to make it better and better in the next versions..!
